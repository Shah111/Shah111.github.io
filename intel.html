<font color = white><p text-align = right;>Step Up to the Next Level with the 7th Gen Intel Core Desktop Processors. The performance of the i7-8565U depends on the cooling solution of the laptop and the defined TDP limits for short and long term performance. We already saw big differences for Kaby Lake-R (e.g., i7-8550U benchmarks), especially for long term (sustained) performance. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the additional Turbo  clock speed can be made use of. It looks like Intel is promoting the i7 to be 3 - 11% faster than the previous i7-8550U, with Cinebench R15 Multi reaching 5% gains.</p>

<font color = white><p text-align = right;>Intel Core i7 is a line of Intel CPUs which span eight generations of Intel chipsets. They feature either four or six cores, with stock frequencies between 2.6 and 3.7 GHz. The first i7 processors were released in November 2008.</p>

<font color = white><p text-align = right;>Some high-performance i7 processors for desktop computers, such as the i7-8700K, are unlocked for overclocking. High-efficiency i7 processors (which conserve energy as much as possible, at the expense of some performance) are manufactured for desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices.</p>
